1: must use atomicCAS, otherwise the items will not be stable and not correct. the reason is not sure now. The
reason is the atomic operation's effects.
2:road_central has large diameter, its iteration number is large (as large as 3827). This is maybe one of the reasons
it takes much long time. The solution may be to use a shared software worklist to replace
the frequent array copy between host and device.
3:globalSize can be changed, but the localSize cannot be changed. We use device exchange (contents exchange, not pointer)
between in_frontier and out_frontier. And use variable globalSize to improve performance.
4:bfs_kernel should use varied globalSize and we also use copy buffer to exchange device arrays.
