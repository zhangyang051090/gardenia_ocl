Kernel: Triangle Counting (TC)
Author: Xuhao Chen

Will count the number of triangles (cliques of size 3)

Requires input graph:
  - to be undirected
  - no duplicate edges (or else will be counted as multiple triangles)
  - neighborhoods are sorted by vertex identifiers

Other than symmetrizing, the rest of the requirements are done by SquishCSR
during graph building.

This implementation reduces the search space by counting each triangle only
once. A naive implementation will count the same triangle six times because
each of the three vertices (u, v, w) will count it in both ways. To count
a triangle only once, this implementation only counts a triangle if u > v > w.
Once the remaining unexamined neighbors identifiers get too big, it can break
out of the loop, but this requires that the neighbors to be sorted.

Another optimization this implementation has is to relabel the vertices by
degree. This is beneficial if the average degree is high enough and if the
degree distribution is sufficiently non-uniform. To decide whether or not
to relabel the graph, we use the heuristic in WorthRelabelling.
